#How to run
Download the files from the PacMen repository, save them to a folder, and drag and drop the PacMen.html file onto an empty webpage. Once the webpage has been populated click on the "Add PacMan" button to add one PacMan per click and then "Start Game" to make the PacMen move at their own pace. Note, for every time the "Start Game" button is clicked the PacMen will move at a quicker pace.
