# PackMen-Exercise
* For this exercise, the arrays methods and techniques for manipulating the Document Object Model a webpage is created that produces PacMen upon the click of a button that move at their own pace.

How to run
* Download the files from the PacMen repository, save them to a folder, and drag and drop the PacMen.html file onto an empty webpage. Once the webpage has been populated click on the "Add PacMan" button to add one PacMan per click and then "Start Game" to make the PacMen move at their own pace. Note, for every time the "Start Game" button is clicked the PacMen will move at a quicker pace.

Future Improvements

Future improvements for the PacMen exercise consist of adding the pacman background and making the the images follow the set path and not just bouncing around. Another potential improvement is allowing the user to determine the movement of the pacman with the use of arrow keys or mouse.
